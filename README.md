# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 
This project was used as a means of utilising and testing the knowledge I have acquired during the prework module phase. 

Throughout this time, I have acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, whilst also learning about the fundamentals of code and the growth mindset required in order to succeed with coding.
